  "agent: Expanded task: The user requests the agent to perform a network connectivity test by sending ICMP echo request packets (commonly known as \"pings\") to Yandex's servers from their Virtual Private Server (VPS). This task involves executing the command `ping yandex.com` or identifying and pinging an appropriate domain for Yandex services. The purpose is to verify if the VPS can successfully connect to Yandex\u2019s servers, ensuring network connectivity. Check for any packet loss, latency, or timeout issues in the response from Yandex's servers during this process. If there are connectivity problems, further investigation into potential causes such as firewall settings, network configuration, or ISP-related issues may be necessary.",

  "agent: Summary:\nThe task involved performing a network connectivity test by pinging Yandex's servers from a Virtual Private Server (VPS) to verify successful connection and assess for any packet loss, latency, or timeout issues. The command `ping -c 4 yandex.com` was executed once, sending four ICMP echo requests to the domain `yandex.com`. The output indicated that all packets were successfully received with no packet loss, showcasing round-trip times ranging from 18.024 ms to 22.143 ms and an average latency of approximately 19.310 ms. This confirmed reliable network connectivity between the VPS and Yandex's servers, completing the task successfully without any failed attempts or command repetitions."
